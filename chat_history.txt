2. More readers and views from search engines.
3. Greater authority and trustworthiness in online research.

**Note:** The article is a dynamic list, with new articles being added regularly. It's also worth noting that not all articles that meet the criteria for Featured Article status are currently featured, as the process of review and selection can be time-consuming.

I hope this summary provides a good overview of the Wikipedia:Featured Articles page!

You: Can you create a simple program on Java which calculates the volume of the triangle?
Llama3.2: Here's a simple Java program that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula and then uses this area to calculate its volume.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TriangleVolumeCalculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the lengths of three sides:");
        double sideA = scanner.nextDouble();
        double sideB = scanner.nextDouble();
        double sideC = scanner.nextDouble();

        if (sideA + sideB <= sideC || sideA + sideC <= sideB || sideB + sideC <= sideA) {
            System.out.println("This is not a valid triangle.");
            return;
        }

        double semiPerimeter = calculateSemiPerimeter(sideA, sideB, sideC);
        double area = calculateArea(semiPerimeter, sideA, sideB, sideC);

        System.out.printf("The area of the triangle is %.2f square units.%n", area);
        double volume = calculateVolume(area, sideA, sideB, sideC);

        System.out.printf("The volume of the triangle is %.2f cubic units.%n", volume);
    }

    private static double calculateSemiPerimeter(double sideA, double sideB, double sideC) {
        return (sideA + sideB + sideC) / 2;
    }

    private static double calculateArea(double semiPerimeter, double sideA, double sideB, double sideC) {
        double area = Math.sqrt(semiPerimeter * (semiPerimeter - sideA) * (semiPerimeter - sideB) * (semiPerimeter - sideC));
        return area;
    }

    private static double calculateVolume(double area, double sideA, double sideB, double sideC) {
        // Since this is a right triangle, volume = 0.5 * base * height
        if (Math.pow(sideA, 2) + Math.pow(sideB, 2) == Math.pow(sideC, 2)) {
            return 0.5 * area * sideA;
        } else {
            // Otherwise use the standard formula: volume = 1/3 * base * height * width
            double height = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(sideA, 2) + Math.pow(sideB, 2));
            double width = sideC;
            return (1.0 / 3.0) * area * height * width;
        }
    }
}
```

This program first checks if the given lengths can form a triangle. Then it calculates and prints the area using Heron's formula, which is valid for all triangles. The volume of a right-angled triangle is calculated as half the product of its base and height (which are sides A and B), while the volume of non-right angled triangles is calculated using the standard volume formula.
